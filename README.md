# Hugging Face For Developers

This is a repository to explore Hugging Face models and hub capabilities **code-first** from a developer perspective - going from prompt engineering to production deployment.

I'll explore the Hugging Face Hub capabilities for rapid prototyping (with free and pro account features) and then explore the path to deployment (with Azure) with initial focus on models available on the [Hugging Face Collection](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models?selectedCollection=huggingface) on the Azure AI Model catalog.
