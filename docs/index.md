# Welcome!

This is a website and blog for documenting my learning journey with Hugging Face models, tools and applications - with three main objectives:

1. **Learn** - with a code-first approach and hands-on labs.
1. **Share** - by authoring blogs & tutorials I can revisit later.
1. **Contribute** - by providing feedback, fixing bugs or adding docs.

Follow me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nityan) and [**Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/nityan) to keep up with updates.
