# 1. Hub Python SDK

## Learning Resources

The [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index) library is the primary SDK for working programmatically with the Hugging Face Hub. Here are the three main resources needed to explore it:

- [Conceptual guides](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/concepts/git_vs_http) - high-level explainers of the Hub features.
- [API reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/overview) - `huggingface_hub` package classes and methods.
- [How-to guides](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/overview) - practical guides for achieving core tasks


## Hands-on Labs

!!! task "Get Started With Notebooks"

    We'll use Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on labs. It gives us built-in documentation and reproducible code snippets for reuse. To get started with a lab:

    - Launch the dev container on your fork of the repo
    - Visit the `labs/01-huggingface` folder in the VS Code file explorer
    - Look for the named lab notebook below and click it to open notebook
    - Click "Select Kernel" and pick the default Python environment shown
    - Click "Clear Outputs" then "Run All" to execute the notebook end-to-end.
