# Core Concepts

The generative AI ecosystem evolves rapidly and it can be hard to keep up with all the terms and concepts. This page captures key terms and concepts (as I encounter them) in a FAQ format. Later, I'll expand these into longer posts organized into relevant themes.

??? info "What is GGUF vs GGML?"

    [From this article:](https://medium.com/@phillipgimmi/what-is-gguf-and-ggml-e364834d241c)

    GGUF and GGML are file formats used for storing models for inference, especially in the context of language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
    
     - GGML (GPT-Generated Model Language) is a tensor library designed for machine learning, facilitating large models and high performance on various hardware, including Apple Silicon
     - GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is the successor to GGML. It represents a significant step forward in the field of language model file formats, facilitating enhanced storage and processing of LLMs like GPT.
